#+TITLE: Parameter Caching
* Overview
=Parameter Caching= is a technique that uses some sort of
memory caching to keep track of changes to a parameter.
In the context of DSP, this is often used for filters so
that filter coefficients do not need to be constantly
updated.
* Coding Conventions in Sndkit
In sndkit, the convention for parameter caching is to use
two variables =var= and =pvar=, with =pvar= being the cached
variable, and =var= being the one externally set. In
the compute loop, these variables would be checked for
changes:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
if (var != pvar) {
    pvar = var;
    /* expensive computation goes here */
}
#+END_SRC
* Examples
Some algorithms that use parameter caching include
@!(ref "bigverb")!@, @!(ref "peakeq")!@, and
@!(ref "env")!@.
