##
random line between 200-500hz

set the rate to be very vast (0.1hz: slow,
20hz: fast, perceptually almost spectrum).

This dynamic range should cause an interesting
performance.

rate of change is 2hz, so every 0.5s there's
should be a noticeable change.

This example is quite exagerated, but jitseg
can be used in very small and subtle ways to
add detail.
